# Project Proposal - Face Mask Detection

#### Question/need:

- Can we build a tool that helps identify person with or without face mask using deep learning algorithm?
- There are a few use cases where this mask detection could be beneficial - airports, hospitals, office and working spaces.

#### Data Description:

I plan on using the Face Mask Detection Images Dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ashishjangra27/face-mask-12k-images-dataset) that contains 11,800 images of face with mask and without mask.

#### Tools:

Deep learning algorithm - Keras

If there's enough time, I'll deploy the model with Streamlit.

#### MVP Goal:

Identify the person on image wearing face mask or not using deep learning algorithm.
